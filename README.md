# careermap

**A small app to map career paths**

The notebook is very hacky, but it might be easier to develop new things there
instead of in the app.

The app is a `flask` app. Run it with:

    flask run

## Requirements

You'll need
[`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html) and [`flask`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/). So far, everything else is standard library.

Or just do this from this directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Demo

This app is no longer deployed anywhere.
